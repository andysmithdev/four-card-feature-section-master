## My process

### Built with

- CSS

### What I learned

Pleased with how this turned out. Obviously various ways to acheive the result, but I think a Grid view works best as its simple and allows you to keep the cards centered on the page easily with justify-content: center. Avoids lots of tedious mucking about with floats.
